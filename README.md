# Flight visualization project in Kerbal Space Program
This repository contains python project, which was made to automate rocket launch is Kerbal Space Program rocket simulator

## who it might be useful for

It might be useful for people who are interested in science engeneering and familiar with some programming languages and able to use different API's and create their own applications based on them

## what does the project allow you to do

With a help of this project you can visualize fligh of your space vessel in KSP. It contains enough presets
to use buildt-in plots (such as trajectory plot, ttw plot e.t.c), which can be useful on a takeoff part flight of a rocket.

## possible options of developments

This project assumes an extension for automatization and writing autopilot that can manage by a flight itself.

## installation

To run this project, you should have already install KSP client on your computer
(я знаю, что Вы как проверяющий скорее всего не будете этого делать, поэтому можете перейти сразу в конец).

After downloading it, you should configure virtual enviroment which satisfies requirements.txt (see the project
to find this file)

After that all you need to do is to simply run main.py

## demonstration

You can see an example of usage [here](https://disk.yandex.ru/i/ay91iQwyT7xiyg).
